Hello! This is the code for my personal website. In creating this website I have dabbled with the following skills and technologies:

Html5 and CSS3
Ecmascript and ES6

This project is my first because I wanted to have a trophy case to show all of my work in, so I figured getting a trophy case 
before the trophies would be a smart idea. 

Home page

The home page was the most fun to work with from a design standpoint. Theres many ways you can choose to style the front page, 
and its easy to get stuck in analysis paralysis. I decided on style that mixed elements i liked with other elements and functionalities
I saw in other projects I liked. The goal is to be simple yet efficient, and I wanted the website to be visually appealing and easy to work
through. This is evident by the one-click design to get to any page, from any page.
